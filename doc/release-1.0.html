<h2 align="center">Release Notes for Mylar 1.0</h2>
<p>Mylar’s task-focused user interface is a new technology that represents a 
fundamental shift in the way
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">IDEs</a> 
work. As the complexity of applications has grown, IDEs have made it easier to 
browse and edit the structure of these systems. Content assist provided instant 
access to that modularity in the editor, while refactoring has facilitated 
making structural changes.&nbsp; As the size of systems has continued to grow 
IDEs' structure views have become overloaded with thousands of elements. 
Searches often return hundreds of hits.&nbsp; The resulting information overload 
has been causing us to waste a tremendous amount of time browsing, scrolling, 
and navigating to identify the information we need. What’s worse is that we’re 
constantly multi-tasking, and whenever we switch tasks we waste yet more time 
re-creating this context. </p>
<p>The key intuition behind Mylar is that for any task that we do, any bug that 
we need to fix or feature we add, we only care about a subset of the system. 
Mylar makes this subset explicit by automatically managing
<a href="http://kerstens.org/mik/publications/2006-11-mylar-fse.pdf">task 
context</a> on our behalf.&nbsp; The result is that structure views show only 
the relevant information, changes are grouped by task, multi-tasking only 
requires a single click, and expertise becomes easy to share.&nbsp; </p>
<h4>History </h4>
<p>In 2003, I was working on integrating new modularity technologies with IDEs. 
Aspect-oriented programming tools like <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/">
AspectJ</a>, as well as model-driven development tools, can remove significant 
amounts of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_complexity">
accidental complexity</a> that creeps into our systems. But even with improved 
modularity, it became clear to me that the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_complexity">essential complexity</a> 
of systems would continue growing, while our ability to deal with that 
complexity would not. I knew that <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphy/">Gail 
Murphy</a>, a professor at the University of British Columbia, had a deep 
appreciation for this problem and would have a uniquely practical and empirical 
approach to finding a solution as evidenced by the
<a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/spl/projects/feat/">FEAT</a> and
<a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/spl/projects/hipikat/">Hipikat</a> research 
projects. I had a feeling that this problem could be solved with her guidance, 
and she convinced me that the best way to find a solution was by doing a PhD.
</p>
<p>I have loved programming since I was ten years old, when I learned English 
from a <a href="http://www.computercloset.org/TimexSinclairZX1000.htm">Sinclair 
ZX1000</a> manual. At <a href="http://www.parc.com/">Xerox PARC</a> got infected 
with a passion for building tools that make people more productive. What would 
sometimes slow me down is
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury">RSI</a> that 
resulted from very long workdays. The start of my thesis gave me a chance to 
reflect on what the underlying problem was: I was constantly clicking the mouse 
and keyboard to find and re-find the information I needed to get work done. What 
I hadn’t noticed before is that I was always browsing for the same elements, and 
that the IDE was showing them within a deep hierarchy instead of grouping them 
in a more reasonable way. Gail and I brainstormed weekly on how the structure 
relevant to developers’ tasks could be identified and presented. She instilled 
in me the need to validate any whacky ideas that we came up with via user 
studies, and in August of 2004 we installed
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mylar/publications/2005-03-mylar-aosd.pdf">Mylar 
0.1</a> on six IBM developers’ desktops. We measured their usage patterns before 
and after they had Mylar, and found that when the IDE views were focused on 
task, they would spend more time programming and less time clicking around 
looking for the information they needed to program. </p>
<p>We presented
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mylar/publications/2005-03-mylar-eclipsecon-web.ppt">
Mylar 0.2</a> at the EclipseCon 2005 conference in order to find more study 
subjects. This caught the eye of <a href="http://eclipse-projects.blogspot.com/">
Bjorn-Freeman Benson</a>, who got the idea instantly, and suggested that we 
propose Mylar as an eclipse.org project. On July 4th, 2005 we released
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mylar/doc/new-0.3.html">Mylar 0.3</a> to the 
first hundred developers who were willing to participate in our user study. Four 
months later we had collected enough data to validate with statistical 
significance that <a href="http://kerstens.org/mik/publications.html">Mylar 
makes programmers more productive</a>. Thanks to the constant releases and the 
fact that all work done on Mylar was done with Mylar, we had produced a 
reasonably well-integrated tool that we were happy to share with others.
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mylar/doc/new-0.4.html">Mylar 0.4</a> was our 
first public release on eclipse.org, and happened on November 4th, 2005. </p>
<p>At that point, an amazing thing happened, and has continued happening since. 
Developers kept getting
<a href="http://jroller.com/page/eu?entry=the_most_addictive_eclipse_plugin">
addicted to Mylar</a>. Like us, they couldn’t imagine working without it, and 
became as passionate about having it support their workday as we were. A steady 
stream of bug reports started rolling in, and defined how programmers needed 
Mylar to work in order to support their development process. Many bug reports 
were accompanied by patches that helped Mylar evolve to meet these ever 
increasing needs. Since then we have resolved 1826 bug reports, over 200 of 
which were resolved by community contributions. </p>
<p>The result is <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mylar/doc/new.php">Mylar 1.0</a>, 
which integrates task context seamlessly across the Eclipse IDE, and brings 
developers’ tasks into Eclipse via connectors to the Bugzilla, JIRA, Trac, as 
well as other web-based repositories. More importantly, Mylar 1.0 provides 
frameworks to integrate task context with other kinds of artifacts and task 
repositories, enabling future versions of Mylar to bring the benefits of task 
context to a rapidly growing number of developers. </p>
<h4>Credits </h4>
<p>Gail Murphy and the <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca">Department of Computer 
Science</a> at the University of British Columbia created the academic 
environment that made it possible to bring Mylar from a research idea, to a tool 
used daily by thousands of developers, all in less than 3 years. The
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/cas/">IBM Centre for Advanced Studies</a> and
<a href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/">NSERC</a> funding of my PhD made it 
possible for me to focus all of my energy on the implementation and validation 
of Mylar. </p>
<p><a href="http://robertelves.com/">Robert Elves</a>, whom Gail and I 
discovered after seeing his research in the use of Eclipse navigation to rank 
editors by relevance, is the main reason that the Tasks framework works as well 
as it does today. His relentless drive and tireless effort have single-handedly 
supported the requests and needs of hundreds of Mylar users.
<a href="http://steffenpingel.de/">Steffen Pingel</a> and
<a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/eu">Eugene Kuleshov</a> have provided 
countless valuable contributions to Mylar, and thanks to the eclipse.org process 
of meritocracy, have become committers on the project without ever meeting face 
to face with the other members of the team. The following individuals have also 
made significant contributions leading up to Mylar 1.0 (in order of bugs 
resolved): Shawn Minto, Ken Sueda, Jeff Pound, Wesley Coelho, Willian Mitsuda, 
Brock Janiczak, Lean Findlater, Nathan Hapke, Raphael Ackermann, Meghan Allen, 
and Gunnar Wagenknecht. </p>
<p>Mylar would not have been possible without the remarkable extensibility of 
the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse Platform</a>. We extend a huge 
thank you to the amazing teams that created the Eclipse SDK, and to their 
self-hosted and open philosophy of building tools. Those principles resulted in 
the most extensible tool framework the world has seen, a vibrant community, and 
a platform for innovation. </p>
<p>Finally, the seeds of these ideas came from
<a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~gregor/">Gregor Kiczales</a> constantly repeating 
“less is more” over my shoulder when I was getting buried in complexity, and 
“first things first” when I was mismanaging my tasks. It brings me great 
satisfaction to know that we have automated his advice.<br>
