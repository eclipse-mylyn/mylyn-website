Mylar is a task focused UI for Eclipse that makes working with very large workspaces 
as easy as working with small ones. It provides task management facilities and 
monitors your work activity to identify information relevant to the task-at-hand. 
Mylar uses this task context to focus the Eclipse UI on what's interesting, hide 
what's uninteresting, and search out what's related.
