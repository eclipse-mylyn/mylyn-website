        Mylar is evolving 
		rapidly, and slowly stabilizing initial APIs and 
		extension points.&nbsp; If you plan on extending 
		the tool we suggest that you bring this up as a 
		discussion on
		<a href="mailto:mylar-dev@eclipse.org">
		mylar-dev@eclipse.org</a>.&nbsp; Also consider 
		looking at the bugzilla
		<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?query_format=specific&order=relevance+desc&bug_status=__open__&product=Mylar&content=[discussion]">
		discussions of new and planned features</a>.  
          
        <h3>Conventions</h3>
		<p>Every task that results in code or resource modification should 
		correspond to a bugzilla report, and should be performed using Mylar.</p>
        
        - <b>Bugzilla priorities</b>: P1: do this week, P2: should do 
		this week, P3: considered for next week, P4 &amp; P5: requires user input to be 
		prioritized.<br>
		- <b>Planning</b>: the week's plan is sent out each Monday, if you would 
		like a task included mark the report P2 or higher.<br>
		- <b>Creating patches</b>: right-click the 
		corresponding project and select Team -&gt; Create 
		Patch.&nbsp; Repeat for each project, naming the 
		patch accordingly (e.g. patch-core.txt, patch-core.tests.txt). 
		Please submit a unit test along with the patch.<br>
		- <b>Before committing: </b>
		make sure that there are no warnings, and that org.eclipse.mylar.tests.AllTests 
		passes with no console output<br>
		- <b>Committing</b>: paste the bug report number and title into the 
		comment, no other description required.<h3>Workspace Setup</h3>
        
        Building Mylar feature from 
		HEAD requires Eclipse 
		SDK 3.2M2 and JDK 1.5.&nbsp; To set up a workspace 
		for mylar development:<br>
		- Add CVS location: dev.eclipse.org 
		/home/technology<br>
		- Check out all of the projects under 
		org.eclipse.mylar (except mylar.aspectj, 
		mylar.sandbox, mylar.viz, and mylar.zest which have additional 
		dependencies)<br>
		- Everything should compile without any warnings<br>
		<br>
		Eclipse 3.1 requires checking out a branch: <br>
		- Right-click the org.eclipse.mylar.java 
		project, Team -&gt; Switch to Another Branch...<br>
		- Refresh the Branches and select eclipse_3_1
        		
        <p>Bugzilla support can be built independently of the Mylar UI:<br>
		- Add CVS location as above
		<br>
		- Check out org.eclipse.mylar: bugzilla.core, bugzilla.ui, bugzilla.test, 
		mylar.tasklist, mylar.core </p>
		AspectJ support requires the 
		AJDT plug-ins to be installed:<br>
		- Create a fresh Eclipse (e.g. eclipse-3.1-ajdt) 
		and install the AJDT plug-in from 
		download.eclipse.org/technology/ajdt/31/dev/update<br>
		- In your original Eclipse: File -&gt; Import -&gt; 
		Existing Plug-ins, then specify the Plug-in 
		location and hit Next<br>
		- Select the following 7 plug-ins: 
		org.aspectj.ajde+runtime, 
		org.eclipse.ajdt.core+ui, 
		org.eclipse.contribution.visualiser+xref
