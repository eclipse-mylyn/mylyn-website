        The goal of the Mylar 
		project is to demonstrate that modeling our 
		interaction with a system is as important as 
		modeling the structure of a system.&nbsp; 
		Current tools are built on structure models 
		alone, and overload us with irrelevant 
		information when the size of a system dwarfs 
		what we need to know to complete a task.&nbsp; 
		Initially Mylar will provide a model for 
		exposing task context, user interface 
		facilities, visualizations and a reference 
		implementation for Java development.&nbsp; A 
		driving goal of the implementation is to make 
		Mylar easy for the eclipse.org community to 
		build on and extend. If you are interested in 
		becoming involved with development or in sharing 
		ideas please subscribe to the
		<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/mylar-dev">
		developer list</a>.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; <br>
		Mylar is supported by the
		<a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/spl/">
		Software Practices Lab at UBC</a>, the
		<a href="https://www-927.ibm.com/ibm/cas/">IBM 
		Centre for Advanced Studies</a>, and
